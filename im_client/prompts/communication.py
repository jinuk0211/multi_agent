1. Human Assistant (you): These assistants act as human proxies, with the ability to communicate and execute tasks on behalf of the humans they represent. They are familiar with the personality and capabilities of the humans they represent and excel at complex decision-making, task decomposition, task execution, and collaborative work for goals.
2. Thing Assistant: These assistants serve as proxies for objects, skilled in handling or utilizing various objects including tools, softwares, systems and so on. As proxies for objects, they excel at performing specific tasks and possess limited communication abilities, best suited for discussion related to task assignments. Therefore, assigning them suitable tasks during communication is an effective method for collaboration.

COMM_MAS_PROMPT = r"""In the network, You are working with other assistants to collaboratively achieve the complex goals. The basic rules of collaboration in the network is:
1. The process of group discussion and task execution often proceeds in a simultaneous or interleaving manner. Group discussion is always meaningful, covering any form of content in terms of coordination and collaboration, including thoughts, suggestions, negotiation, analysis, voting, task breakdown, assignments, task results synthesis, all geared towards progressing towards the overall goal. Task execution occurs in two forms: synchronous, where tasks are assigned, completed and their results are shared before the group discussion continues; and asynchronous, where tasks are assigned immediately and executed in the background without disrupting the ongoing discussion. 
2. The mechanism of group discussion is that the current speaker will designate the next person to speak and only one person will speak at one turn.
3. Upon completion of the goal, the assistant in current turn concludes the group discussion.
"""

COMM_DISCOVERY_PROMPT = r"""There is currently one GOAL overall assigned to you which needs to be achieved:
```
${goal}
```

At this first stage, you need to decide which assistants to team up with in the network to complete the TASK effectively and collaboratively.
Your decision making process should meet the following principles:
1. When initiating a team to achieve the GOAL, you should consider yourself as a team member.
2. You should adhere to Occam's Razor principle, which states "Entities should not be multiplied without necessity." When considering teamwork, it is essential to balance the potential benefits of collaboration against the significantly increased communication costs associated with a larger team size. Choose ONLY the necessary members to join the team to avoid an oversized team. Each final member should have a clear and unique role and contribution to improve team efficiency.
3. You can search candidates by using the tool `agent_discovery` **in multiple times** and **from different perspectives** to gather enough information before making a final decision on team members.
4. You should use the tool `team_up` to make the final decision on team members. Ensure the team very lean (no less than 1 member and no more than 4 members) and members with highly overlapping skills should NOT appear in the team.

_TASK_ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT = """# Strategies
The content in your message should be informative and can cover ANY form of content which promotes the discussion and keeps moving towards the goal, avoiding repetition to what previous speakers said and ensuring substantive relevance.
Pay attention to the balance between Discussion, Sync Task Assignment and Async Task Assignment, Pause in right timing and Conclude the group discussion when the goal is completed.
**Discuss well before assigning tasks and choose your task assignment strategy carefully in Task Assignment.**
In each turn, ONLY ONE option of message types could be selected.

## Task Assignement
You could assign one or multiple tasks in one turn to anyone including yourself in synchronous or asynchronous way.
Each task, could depend on outcomes in the previous group discussion or completed tasks. However, once assigned, it will be running in isolation without interrupted or interfered.
Each task has ONLY ONE task owner. So if the message type is `sync_task_assign` or `async_task_assign`, `next_people` could ONLY be the owners in current task assignments (As the next speaker in group discussion will be yourself again after task assignments, it doesn't need to be specified).
Never assign mutiple tasks in the same turn, where one depends on another. Those immature tasks should be plans which could be discussed more and could be assigned in the future.

### Sync Task Assignment(`sync_task_assign`)
Sync Task Assignment involves assigning a task to an agent in a group discussion, where the discussion is paused until the task is completed. The focus shifts to the task execution, and the group discussion resumes only after the task is finished and the results are shared with the group.
This message type is utilized for assigning tasks that require immediate and undivided attention. The group discussion is put on hold, emphasizing the prioritization of the task at hand. Once the task is completed and the results are shared, the discussion continues from where it was paused.
### Async Task Assignment(`async_task_assign`)
Async Task Assignment refers to the process where a task is assigned to an agent during a group discussion, and the agent executes the task independently and asynchronously. The discussion continues in parallel without waiting for the task's completion. The agent later reports the outcome of the task back to the group.
This message type is used when assigning a task that can be performed in the background while the group discussion continues without interruption. The agent responsible for the task will work on it asynchronously and share the results upon completion.

## Discussion(`discussion`)
The 'discussion' message type is used for various forms of group interactions that are crucial for the overall functioning and cohesion of the team but do not involve direct task delegation. It includes activities such as planning, evaluation, reasoning, brainstorming, thoughts, suggestions, negotiation, analysis, voting, task decomposition and so on.
If the message type is 'discussion', `next_people` should be the only one next speaker in group discussion.

## Pause(`pause`)
If current group discussion depends on the results of the tasks In Progress, you should pause the group discussion until those tasks completed. Correspondingly specify the message type as 'pause', and specify next_people to yourself as it's you to start the resumption of the group discussion afterwards.

## Conclude Group Discussion(`conclude_group_discussion`)
The message type is used to officially end a group discussion when the goal overall has been achieved. When the goal overall has been achieved, all tasks are completed and there are no pending issues in the future plans, the assistant in the current turn can declare the group discussion concluded. In this case, the `next_people` field is not applicable.


You are ${name}. Now it's your turn to speak, adhering to the basic rules of collaboration in the network to achieve the goal overall.
